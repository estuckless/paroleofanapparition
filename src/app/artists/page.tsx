            <h2 className="font-semibold">KEVIN DARYL FERDINANDUS (AUSTRIA)</h2>
            <p>Kevin Daryl Ferdinandus (born in Coburg, Germany) is a media artist and videographer exploring the function of digital machines in ideological and political systems and networks. Focussing on errors, he challenges the notion of technological perfection and infallibility and draws attention to the inner workings of digital media and networks.</p>
            <p>His works take digital form, primarily as video or image, without being limited to these media. What unites them methodologically is the use of the wrong tool, the wrong software, or deliberate sabotage of the mechanical part of production. This often results in an alienating aesthetic, revealing organic-looking structures and patterns within the digital realm.</p>

His work has been shown internationally, including Austria, Germany, Italy, Taiwan, Sydney, India, the United States, France, Bulgaria, and China.</p>

Her current work explores the dissolution of the real in favour of more &ldquo;productive&rdquo; concepts within a capitalism confronted with resource scarcity. Laura works and lives in Vienna.</p>
